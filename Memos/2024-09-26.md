vCenter Unique ID calculation
Let’s explore other aspects of identifying a MAC address of VMware vCenter.

As explained above, a MAC address for vCenter is assigned from the range (00:50:56:80:00:00 – 00:50:56:BF:FF:FF) in the 00:50:56:XX:YY:ZZ format.

In this case, the XX value is calculated based on the vCenter unique ID.

XX=80+vCenterID

If you know the MAC address of vCenter, you can calculate the vCenter Server Unique ID (can be 0 to 63).

Let’s look at an example when we have vCenter Server deployed as a VM which network interface has a VMware MAC address:

00:50:56:9B:48:55

Subtract 80 from 9B (hexadecimal). You can use the HEX calculator.

0x9B – 0x80 = 0x1B

Convert the HEX value to a decimal value:

0x1B = 27

vCenter Unique ID is 27 in this case.
