/* AsyncQueue
 *
 * THREAD SAFE
 *
 * AsyncQueue is used when one thread sends a notification of job completion to
 * another thread.
 *
 * Common usage is:
 * + Master thread create an AsyncQueue with an event_handler function.
 * + Master thread is looping in an EventLoop.
 * + Master thread schedules an async job to a slave thread with a done object
 *   which could be generated by AsyncQueue::GenerateCallback.
 * + After slave thread finishes the job, it will call done to notify master
 *   thread.
 * + When master thread is free and received the event, it will call the
 *   event_handler to handle the event.
