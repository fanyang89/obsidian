```
-> % sudo pro disable realtime-kernel 
This will remove the boot order preference for the Real-time kernel and
disable updates to the Real-time kernel.

This will NOT fully remove the kernel from your system.

After this operation is complete you must:
  - Ensure a different kernel is installed and configured to boot
  - Reboot into that kernel
  - Fully remove the realtime kernel packages from your system
      - This might look something like `apt remove linux*realtime`,
        but you must ensure this is correct before running it.
